They have a strong foundation in Python, TensorFlow, and Scikit-learn, which are essential for the role. They also have experience with Flask and OCR, which are relevant for developing and deploying machine learning models. However, there is a lack of experience with Docker, APIs (REST, FastAPI/Flask), Docker, Git version control, and model lifecycle management in production, which are core requirements. Their background in creating an ANPR system using TensorFlow suggests familiarity with ML workflows, but there’s a gap in deploying models via Docker and working with vector databases.","['Salesforce AI Associate', 'Data Science For Engineers – IIT MADRAS with NPTEL(ELITE)', 'AWS Educate']","[{'Project Name': 'ANPR and ATCC For Smart Traffic Management System', 'Description': 'Developed an intelligent traffic management system using Deep Learning for Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) and Automated Traffic Control System (ATCC).', 'Technologies Used': ['Python', 'OpenCV', 'TensorFlow', 'CNNs', 'OCR', 'YOLO Model']}, {'Project Name': 'Bug Vidhya', 'Description': 'Created an educational website offering Python and Java tutorials, featuring a built-in code editor for real-time code execution.', 'Technologies Used': ['HTML', 'CSS', 'JavaScript', 'Python', 'Flask', 'ACE API']}]","['collaboration', 'problem-solving', 'teamwork', 'communication']",7,6,4,750,75.0
