However, the job description emphasizes non-technical skills like writing, client communication, and industry knowledge, which are not strongly featured on the resume. The candidate's projects demonstrate advanced technical expertise but do not directly relate to the CV writing and editing role described in the job. Additionally, the resume lacks experience in maintaining confidentiality, communicating with clients, or meeting deadlines, which are crucial for this role. The candidate's educational background and skill set are more aligned with technical and data science roles, which is a mismatch for the CV Intern position.",
